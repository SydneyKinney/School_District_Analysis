# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The students_complete.csv file showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The goal is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, the school district analysis was repeated.
## Results
### - How is the district summary affected?

The total count of students did not change. There were minimal changes when comparing the two charts. For example, the overall passing percentage would be the same number if rounded to the nearest whole number on both charts. The same applies to average math scores, average reading score, percentage passing math, and percentage passing reading.
